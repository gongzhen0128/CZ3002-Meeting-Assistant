Spring drops and the sun outside the window tell me that this spring will be the flowering of our love.
Nothing is going change my love for you, you are the man, who helped me to find myself in this life.
Even the sunniest day, met without you, becomes sullen. Only your love paints all around with bright colors.
I have never thought that three words would change my life completely. I love you and I am ready to shout about it to everyone!
